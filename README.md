### Hello, I'm Do ðŸ™‚  

I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in **statistics**, where I've learned data analysis, probability theory, and some statistical modeling. My current focus lies in the realm of ML and AI. 

As of now, I'm engaged in working on **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** for image generation.

I'm also studying for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. My specific area of interest within **NLP** revolves around retrieval augmented generation **(RAG)**.
